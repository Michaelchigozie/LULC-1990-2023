# LULC-1990-2023

## Project Overview
### Land Use and Land Cover Mapping (1990–2023)
This project focuses on analyzing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes over 33 years, spanning from 1990 to 2023. Using geospatial technologies, the study examines the temporal dynamics of land use, urbanization, vegetation cover, water bodies, and other key land cover classes. The findings highlight environmental transformations, urban sprawl, and ecological changes within the study area, providing insights essential for sustainable development planning and environmental management.

### Study Area

The study area is Enugu Metropolis and its surrounding environs in southeastern Nigeria. This region has experienced significant urbanization, making it an ideal case study for analyzing land use and land cover changes. Enugu Metropolis is situated approximately between latitudes 6.300°N and 6.600°N and longitudes 7.300°E and 7.700°E. The geographical coordinates and specific boundaries of the study area will be delineated using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to ensure precise spatial analysis. The study area includes urban and peri-urban zones, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of various land use patterns and their implications.
As of the most recent census data, the population of Enugu is estimated to be over 820,000 within the city limits, with the larger metropolitan area housing over 1 million residents. This growing population is a key driver of the rapid urbanization observed in the region, further underscoring the importance of this study in understanding the dynamics of land use and land cover changes.




#### Key Objectives:
Mapping LULC Changes: Generate accurate LULC maps for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2023.
Change Detection: Quantify changes in land cover classes over time.
Impacts Analysis: Assess the implications of these changes on the ecosystem and local communities.
Sustainability: Provide actionable recommendations for sustainable land management.

#### Methodology:
Data Sources: Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2).

#### Tools Used:

- ArcGIS for LULC classification
- Supervised image classification techniques.


#### Analysis:

Applied NDVI for vegetation assessment and integrated DEM data for terrain analysis. [Download Here](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e9b4d22595b643c1b690d0c8593b5195)

#### Key Findings:
Significant urban expansion and reduction in vegetation cover.
Changes in water bodies due to climate impacts.
A shift in land use priorities, emphasizing industrial and agricultural growth.

#### Applications:
This study is valuable for urban planners, environmentalists, and policymakers in developing strategies for climate change adaptation, urban planning, and environmental conservation.
